# PS:
Plan was to show image of each exhibit but showing just exhibit/object title & ID (seems exhibit title is not unique, so showing title with ID to differentiate between different exhibits) as not all exhibits have images. Bare minimum details only are shown in the modal popup with exhibit details. Testing not implemented due to lack of time. Started late at night y'day, so had to continue doing today morning after overnight rest. Say user clicks on object link 4 secs after object display, then on resuming (closing object details popup), the present object is shown for 6 secs (10 - 4 secs) instead of 10 secs before next object is displayed on main screen.
